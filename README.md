# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
## Description

This repository contains my projects and exercises completed during a C# and .NET course. It showcases practical applications of core concepts like object-oriented programming, web development with ASP.NET MVC, and database integration using Entity Framework.

## Features

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.

- Web Development: Building multi-page applications using ASP.NET MVC.

- Full-Stack Development: Form handling, CRUD operations, business logic implementation, and SQL Server integration.

- Real-World Projects: Includes a car insurance quote application that demonstrates full-stack development.


## Featured Project: AutoQuote Pro
A full-stack car insurance quoting engine designed to demonstrate the power of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

Logic: Custom algorithm for real-time premium calculation.

Database: Persistent storage using SQL Server with a Code-First approach.

Features: Server-side validation, CRUD functionality, and dynamic UI rendering.

## 🧠 Core Competencies
OOP Mastery: Expert implementation of interfaces, inheritance, and abstraction.

Scalable Architecture: Building reusable libraries and modular classes.

Web Services: Developing robust server-side logic and database integratio
